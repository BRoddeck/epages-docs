The sixth SEOkomm recently took place in Salzburg, Austria.
A day full of topics about search engine optimisation, a nice atmosphere, plenty of good food and many interesting discussions allured over 800 people to the city of Mozart.

The OnPage optimisation turned out to be a recurring topic in nearly all the talks.
Although, as Johannes Müller from Google pointed out in his Q&A-Session, links and off-page optimisation are still very important for Google as a ranking factor.
But the main statement of the SEOkomm was “make good content”, use high quality pictures and videos, don’t write SEO-texts anymore, but focus on your customer.
Find out their requirements, learn their language and terms.
Create and serve their needs.
Don’t show only the product, but also serve trends, offer guidance and give practical tips.
(Buzzword alert!!!!)
Create holistic content.
A nice example, where this is pretty well implemented, is [Schwarzkopf](http://www.schwarzkopf.com).
The hair cosmetic supplier doesn’t only list their products.
They pick up their customers with categories like ‘Trendy Looks’, ‘Hair styling’ or ‘Hair cair’ and give them many tips and ‘How to’-videos to advise their users.
Another way to improve your content is to concentrate on what is really needed.
Sacrifice 10% of your lousiest pages in order to help the other 90% rank better.
Every talk was well worth a visit, but unfortunately I could only make it to one of each of the parallel talks.
I will focus here on three of the talks.

An inspiring keynote was held by [Marcus Tandler](http://www.mediadonis.net/) from onpage.org.
All of his no fewer than 463 slides was it worth listening to.
He spoke about what Google once was and what it has become today - a learning machine - an Artificial Intelligence.
An AI-System, called RankBrain, already analyses the queries in Google and should help to handle questions which are not asked yet.
So probably one day could a smartwatch answer a users question before it is asked.
Tandler used the example of a smartwatch explaining unknown foreign words which it hears in a conversation.
This eavesdropping is, by the way, something that Google is already doing from time to time.
So told speaker [Karl Kratz](http://www.karlkratz.de) in a later talk, that after a chat about steaks with a colleague during a car driving Google now later suggested steak houses.
Scary, isn't it?
But Tandler demanded “a little bit confidence in Google”.
The main goal of Google is to make the user happy and so websites have to be made for the users and not for search engines.
Make good content, reduce loading time and deal with broken links and 404 pages.
This all has influence on user interaction and good user feedback leads to a better ranking.
A big thing for 2016 could be Google’s new framework AMP (Accelerated mobile pages) which is an answer to Facebook’s instant articles and should speed up the loading time on mobile devices.
It uses current web technologies but supports only a subset of HTML (e.g. &lt;script&gt; is forbidden) and CSS and does not allow third-party JavaScript.
All in the name of speed and Google's fight against the use of special Apps which are not searchable.
It is not yet part of any ranking algorithms.

Another excellent talk about [PageSpeed](http://de.slideshare.net/bastiangrimm/mehr-pagespeed-geht-nicht-seokomm-2015) was held by [Bastian Grimm](http://www.peakace.de).
47% of people expect a website to load within 2 seconds, and 40% of the users leave the website if they had to wait longer than three seconds for the page to load fully.
Amazon found out that saving 100ms loading time increases the revenue by 1%.
One second more waiting time decreases the page views by 11% and the conversions by 7%.
So it is still crucial to reduce page loading time.
Optimise the critical rendering path, minify CSS and JS, optimise images, actual caching and compressing on the server etc. is very important.
Use asynchronous requests whenever it’s possible.
Reduce the use of custom web fonts or host them yourself.
Make use of pre-fetching and pre-rendering resources.
For example we could pre-render the basket or checkout after a customer puts an article in.
Or if it is not desired to pre-render everything you could use the Page Visibility API, which helps to load resources conditionally based on their visibility.
Another traffic issue is images.
Pictures constitute 62% of web traffic.
51% of all URLs load more than 40 images per request.
A possible solution is to use alternative image types like Google's WebP, which have a 30% smaller file size than JPEG and are as much as 80% smaller than PNG.
Unfortunately WebP is not supported by Firefox, Safari, IE or Edge yet, but why shouldn’t we serve it to those users who can use it already. One could replace PNGs and JPGs per rewrite via .htaccess or use the HTML5-tag &lt;picture&gt; with &lt;img&gt; as fallback.
There are also other image formats (FLIF, BPG, JPEG XR) in contention.
A final thing which Grimm pointed out was HTTP/2, which was published in May this year.
Currently it's supported by more than 80% of servers and even the Googlebot will support it by end of the year.
The advantage of HTTP/2 is the data compression and the loading of page elements in parallel in a single connection.

The talk of [Karl Kratz](http://www.karlkratz.de) was very thought-provoking.
He asked, why Google is the most famous search engine?
Answer: Because we allow it.
But what can we do against this “Googlegedon”?
We don’t need a new SEO-Partner, we need a new mindset.
Google is good for mainstream searches, but bad for specialties.
Looking for a restaurant in a new city?
You’re searching in Yelp.
Looking for a vacation apartment?
You’re searching in booking.com.
Looking for food delivery?
You’re using Lieferheld.
There are many special search possibilities without using Google.
Even Amazon is a big search engine for many products.
And what if you have a device without keyboard and display?
It’s irrelevant if your hotel is ranked very well in Google but isn’t found asking Apple’s Siri.
Because Siri doesn't use Google search but Bing, Yelp and Yahoo.
A dependency of more than 20% on one search engine is a problem.
So spread your energy, use portals, use different search engines and optimise on “events and contextual incidents”.

All in all it was a good, well organised conference, which I left with a lot of valuable information and thought provoking ideas.
Given the fact that the main heading of the conference was “Ganz großes Kino” (Cinema) we could feel well at home with our slogan “Join the force”.
I really look forward to visiting the SEOkomm again in 2016.
