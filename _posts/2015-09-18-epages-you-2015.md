Creative team presentations, team building activities, workshops and lot's of fun: last weeks' activities and corridor talks at ePages all revolved around the ePages annual company event: the YO(U).
The YO(U) is a formal, annual company event which all ePages employees are required to attend.
This sounds really tough.
But it is not.
It is incredibly fun, although it is hard work, too and involves long hours.

Main goal of the event:

* get to know each other
* unite colleagues from all company locations
* exchange ideas among colleagues, departments and countries.

# Event task force

Already a long time before the actual date of the YO(U), an event task force started their activities to prepare the ground for two awesome days.
To make it a big surprise for everyone, the agenda was kept a secret for a long time.
But soon the time had come to position some teasers and involve the employees.

# Prepare for action

Every team was asked to prepare a 1-minute video, that presents their departments.
To make it short: that was a hell of a lot of fun!
We also had some restrictions for the team presentations itself: hold a 12-minutes presentation and prepare for a 12-minutes Q&A session.
That was definitely a challenge and required time for a careful preparation.

# Patience required

There were rumors that we would go for an outdoor activity.
Soon you heard colleagues whisper and chatter on the corridors, what that might be.
Climbing? Geocaching? City walk?
No chance to find that out.
Staying patient was required.

# Kick-off at the beach

Finally the YO(U) started in a beach club above the city roofs of Hamburg.
We enjoyed a beautiful view across the city, along with food and drinks, a relaxed atmosphere and lots of fun.
Incidentally, we also had the chance to observe a beautiful sundown!

# Opening YO(U)

The next day we all convened at the Hamburg University to spend the first day watching funny and awesome team videos and listening to well-prepared team presentations.
Exciting: which team was going to present was drawn right before the presentation, so every team had to be prepared at all times!

# Dragon boat race

In the afternoon the secret was finally lifted what would be our outdoor activity: we went to a small dock at a branch of the Alster to spend the afternoon with dragon boat races.
This outdoor activity was simply spectacular!
There was so much enthusiasm and ambition amongst the colleagues learning the skills, performing the strokes in sync, being one effective entity to win the race - with a good battle cry, of course.

# Being rewarded

We finished the day chilling out at a restaurant with cocktails and burgers.
The composition of the tables was chosen at random.
Everyone again had to be out of their comfort zones to get to know other colleagues.

# Prepare for the coming day

Just one (short) night to recover from the current events and jump right into the next.
We briefly wrapped up the first day and continued with creative team videos and presentations.
Next to this, we had a speaker presenting future company events as well as a lecture sharing knowledge on our merchants.

# Workshops & wrap-up

The afternoon was packed with workshops as well as a wrap-up of the event.

# Rapturous applause

It has been an awesome event and we all look forward for the next to come!
