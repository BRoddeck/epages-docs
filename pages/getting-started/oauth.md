# OAuth authentication. Why?
Your app cannot access the REST API resources without authenticating first. All API calls are authenticated according to the OAuth 1.0 protocol.

All developers have to register their application before getting started. A registered OAuth 1.0 application is assigned the following:

| Name               | Description                                                                                                                                        |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Consumer key       | Identifier string generated by API for use in OAuth 1.0.                                                                                           |
| Consumer secret    | Unique token generated for use in OAuth 1.0 as an element of creating a signature. The consumer secret should not be shared.                       |
| OAuth token        | Token generated by the server upon signed request. Can be either `request_token` or `access_token` depending on which step in the flow you are on. |
| OAuth token secret | Secret generally sent with the response for a certain token. Used for exchange, signature generation, or refreshing the `access_token`.            |
