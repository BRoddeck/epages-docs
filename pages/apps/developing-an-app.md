# Create an app

## What kind of apps do we support?
In a first approach, we only support external apps. These apps connect via the REST API to the shop to exchange data and let the merchant work with these data within an external service.

## Set-up
1. Within your test shop backoffice, click the tab **Apps**.
2. In the drop down menu, choose **Developer Apps**.
3. In the **Developer Apps** view, click the button **Add**.
3. Fill out the entry field **App name**. This field is mandatory.
4. Click the button **Save**. You will be assigned a unique **Consumer key** and **Consumer secret**. Remember these credentials as you will have to integrate them into the configuration files or the actual code of your application. **Application callback URL** and **Application notification URL** will also be generated.

{% callout danger Important! %}
For your application's own security: DO NOT share your consumer secret with anyone!
{% endcallout %}

The credentials you'll receive might look like this:

Example of OAuth keys
{% endimage %}

Once this is done, you can start coding off. Brilliant: you are free to use any kind of code language.
But when developing your app, please consider our [API call limit](page:apps-using-the-api#api-call-limit).

## Your app is ready for takeoff?

Once the set-up is done, your app will be available in your test shop in the field **My apps**.

## Test. Test. Test.
