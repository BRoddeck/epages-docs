# Create an app

## What kind of apps do we support?
In a first approach, we only support external apps. We call them "connectors". Connectors are not integrated into the merchant's backoffice, but interact with a shop via the REST API to use the shop's data.

## Set-up
1. Within your test shop backoffice, choose the tab **Apps**.
2. Choose the field **Private Apps** and click the button **Create app**.
3. Fill out the entry field **App name**. This field is mandatory.
4. Click the button **Save**. The API data **Consumer key**, **Consumer secret**, **Access token** and **Access secret** will be generated automatically.

Once this is done, you can start coding off. Brilliant: you are free to use any kind of code language.
But when developing your app, please consider our [API call limit](page:apps-getting-started.html#call-limits).

## Your app is ready for takeoff?

Let's go for the [authorisation](page:apps-oauth).
Once this is done, your app will be available in your test shop in the field **My apps**.

## Test. Test. Test.

| What?             | What for?                                                                              |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Delete an app.    | Removes the keys of the app in the **Private app** environment. Testing not mandatory. |
| Uninstall an app. | Ensures, that your app is capable of being uninstalled completely. Testing mandatory.  |

## Delete an app:

In the field **Private apps** click the button **Delete**.
If the process has been successful, the app has been removed from **Private apps**.

## Uninstall an app:

1. In the field **My apps**, click the app.
2. In the new window, click the button **Uninstall**.
3. A dialogue appears that you're about to uninstall your app.
4. Click the button **Uninstall**.

If the process worked just fine, the field **My apps** is empty.
Your app is still available in the field **Private apps**.

## Ready, steady, go!

[Submit your app](page:apps-develop-app#submit-an-app).

# Submit an app

Yay! You're done with developing your awesome app and you're excited to make it available to our App store? Testing is done and everything works fine? Congrats! We are just as much excited as you are!

Let's go submitting your app.

| Consumer key       | Identifier string generated by API for use in OAuth 1.0.                                                                                           |
