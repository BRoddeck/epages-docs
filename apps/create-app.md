Once you have your test shop in place, you can create an app.
You automatically receive a **Client ID** and a **Client Secret** when you create an app in your test shop.
After successful authorisation of your app, you will be assigned an **Access token**.

| Value              | Description                                                                                             |

| **Client&nbsp;ID**      | The unique identifier for your app. |
| **Client&nbsp;Secret**   | Used in combination with the **Client ID** for getting an **Access token** during the [authorisation process](page:apps-install#authorisation-process).|
| **Access&nbsp;token** | The token granted from your test shop to the newly created app. You can use this token for accessing the API. [Read here for further details.](page:apps-install) |
